R-Codes for RSE manuscript "Importance of sample size, data type and prediction method for remote sensing-based estimations of aboveground forest biomass"


This wiki illustrates the workflow of the biomass study presented in the manuscript:
"Importance of sample size, data type and prediction method for remote sensing-based estimations of aboveground forest biomass" (submitted to Remote Sensing of Environment).

R-Codes are provided and some graphs, showing the outputs of each processing step are shown for a better understanding of the processing chain.


**# Step 1 - Modelling**

R-script named "1_modeling.R" will create all data needed for further processing steps. Required input is a tab-separated table in text-format which contains the biomass reference values as well as the remote sensing predictors.

Figure 1 shows an example:
